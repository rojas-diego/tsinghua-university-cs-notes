\section{Four Basic Counting Principles}

\subsection{The Addition Principle}

Suppose that a set $S$ is partitioned into pairwise disjoint parts $S_1,S_2, \dots ,S_m$. The number of objects in $S$ can be determined by finding the number of objects in each of the parts and adding the numbers obtained.
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{gathered}
	S = S_1 \cup S_2 \cup \cdots \cup S_m \\
	|S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \cdots + |S_m|
\end{gathered}
\end{equation}
%
The number of objects of a set $S$ is denoted by $|S|$ and is called the size of $S$.

\subsection{The Multiplication Principle}

Let $S$ be a set of ordered pairs $(a, b)$ of objects, where the first object $a$ comes from a set of size $p$, and for each choice of object $a$ there are $q$ choices for object $b$. Then the size of $S$ is $p \times q$.
\\
It's important for $a$ and $b$ to be independent choices.


\subsection{The Substraction Principle}

Let $A$ be a set and let $U$ be a larger set containing $A$. Let
%
$$
\bar{A} = U \backslash A = \{ x \in U : x \notin A \}
$$
%
be the \textit{complement} of $A$. Then the number of objects in $A$ is given by:
%
$$
|A| = |U| - |\bar{A}|
$$

\subsection{The Division Principle}

Let $S$ be a finite set that is partitioned into $k$ parts in such a way that each part contains the same number of objects. Then the number of parts in the partition is given by the rule:

$$
k = \frac{|S|}{\text{number of objects in a part}}
$$

\section{Permutations of Sets}

We denote $P(n, r)$ the number of $r-permutations$ of a set of $n$ elements.
\\\\
Given $n$ and $r$ are positive integers with $n \geq r$,
%
$$
P(n, r) = n \times (n - 1) \times \cdots \times (n - r + 1)
$$
%
Which can be written as:
%
$$
P(n, r) = \frac{n!}{(n - r)!}
$$
